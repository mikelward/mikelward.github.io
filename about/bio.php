    <p>
      I was born as Michael Wardle in 1980 in
      <a href="http://www.naracoortetourism.com.au/">Naracoorte</a>
      (near Mount Gambier), South Australia.
      I grew up on a large sheep and cattle farm just out of town.
    </p>
    <p>
      I went on a private student exchange in 1995 to
      <a href="http://www.hitzendorf.at/">Hitzendorf</a>
      (near Graz), Austria, where I attended a local business school
      and became nearly fluent in German.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attended Naracoorte High School and Immanuel College,
      before beginning studies in Electrical Engineering at the
      <a href="http://www.adelaide.edu.au/">University of Adelaide</a> in 1999.
    </p>
    <p>
      While studying, I stayed at St Ann's College, where I met Alison who became my girlfrend.
    </p>
    <p>
      After realizing I wanted to work in the computing industry
      I moved to Wodonga, Victoria
      in 2000 to take a traineeship in software engineering at
      <a href="http://www.adacel.com/">Adacel Technologies</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_federal_election,_2001">2001 Australian Federal Election</a>,
      I stood as a candidate for
      <a href="http://www.greens.org.au/">The Greens</a> in the seat of
      <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/i/indi.htm">Indi</a> and
      <a href="http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/federal_elections/2001/results/VICINDI.htm">received 3.8 per cent of the vote</a>
      campaigning mainly on human rights and ecology.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing my Certificate of Software Engineering in 2003, I moved
      to <a href="http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/">Melbourne, Victoria</a>
      to take a job as a computer system administrator
      at <a href="http://www.leighmardon.com.au/">Leigh Mardon</a>
      and continue part-time studies at
      <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au/">Monash University</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2005, I moved in with some friends, Megan and Jodie, in
      <a title="Glen Eira City Council" href="http://www.gleneira.vic.gov.au/">Elsternwick</a>
      in Melbourne's south-eastern suburbs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2006, I won tickets to see
      <a href="http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/match/template.html?id=27&day=18&month=06&year=2006">Australia play against Brazil</a>
      in the
      <a href="http://www.fifaworldcup.com/">soccer world cup</a> in Germany.
      I spent a month in Europe and got to meet lots of relatives and lots of great peeple.
    </p>
    <p>
	  In 2007, I finished uni, and started a job as a system administrator at
      <a href="http://www.aconex.com/">Aconex</a>.
