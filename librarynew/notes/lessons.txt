LESSIONS

Regular expression syntax is weird and poorly documented in PHP (use the PCRE or Perl documentation)
Some web servers (this one was ASP) require HTTP 1.1 and a Host header, which PHP's fopen don't support
ORM is harder than it seems for non-trivial class hierarchies


1.
This didn't work:
GET /dvds/id/855245 HTTP/1.0

This did:
GET /dvds/id/855245 HTTP/1.0
User-Agent: Wget/1.10.2 (Red Hat modified)
Accept: */*
Host: www.jbhifionline.com.au
Connection: Keep-Alive

Site isn't serving any content for the default virtual host?

Different sites also return different content depending on the User-Agent string.

sudo yum install php-devel
sudo yum install pecl_http

	$request = new HttpRequest();
	$request->setUrl($url);
	$request->setMethod("GET");
	$host = preg_replace("#^.*?://(.*?)/.*#", "$1", $url);
	$headers = array("Host" => $host);
	$request->addHeaders($headers);
	$request->send();
