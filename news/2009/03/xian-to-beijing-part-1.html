            <div style="clear:both;"></div>I'm going back to Beijing today.<br /><br />Jimmy had suggested Starbucks for breakfast instead of the buffet.<br /><br />He said there was one just opposite the hotel.<br /><br />When trying to find it, I came by the McDonald's directly opposite and decided to go there instead.<br /><br />All the usual options like bacon and egg McMuffins, but I figured I'd try the weird looking combo.<br /><br />It turns out it consisted of a really, really nice little egg and ham pastry and a spicy chicken burger.  The coffee was bad, but still, it was worth it for the food.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3540-704951.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3540-704539.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Yummy ham and egg pastry for breakfast</p></div><br /><br />The flight wasn't until 1.20pm, so I figured I'd do some walking around and see if I could find some other shops and little interesting things in the inner city.<br /><br />Walked towards the bell tower to see what was beyond it, and lo and behold, there's a Starbucks down, at a plaza down below street level, presumably so that nobody can see it. :-)<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3543-749542.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3543-749114.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Interesting-looking Starbucks</p></div><br /><br />After realizing that there was nothing of interest to the East, I started walking South.<br /><br />Walked by a Chinese brand shoe and sporting goods store.  It's called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anta_Sports">Anta</a> and apparently it's huge here.  Looks rather like Nike.  There's also another brand called Li-Ning that looks like it wants to be Adidas.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3545-735092.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3545-734722.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Storefront for Anta, a Chinese sportswear company</p></div><br /><br />After walking around a bit longer, I happened upon a big plaza (Xing Zheng Yuan Plaza) with a sign for Wal*Mart on it.  I'd never been to WalMart, so I decided I should check it out.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3546-750516.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3546-750105.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Wal*Mart in China? Better check it out!</p></div><br /><br />The stores still weren't open, so I went to a bit of a walk around.<br /><br />Upstairs in the shopping centre, they had an ice skating rink, according to the building directory sign.<br /><br />Around the back, it looked like all the centre workers were waiting to be let it.<br /><br />Then I found a plaza, quite open, with a big TV screen where they were teaching people how to play Othello (a.k.a. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversi">Reversi</a>).<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3549-755827.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3549-755435.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Reversi on the big screen</p></div><br /><br />After tiring of watching the guy play Othello so slowly, I went to a walk in a different direction...<br /><br />... and found the main Wal*Mart entrance, and found it was open!<br /><br />They had a huge range.  It was kind of like a Big W except it was much bigger, and they sold fresh produce as well.<br /><br />In the food aisle, they even had a special section for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamic_acid_(flavor)">MSG</a>. :-)<br /><br />A little way further, and I found exactly what I was looking for!  Chinese-made Gillette blades that are unavailable in Australia.<br /><br />They cost 6.80 RMB (1.40 AUD) for a 5-pack.  I got 10.  Each blade lasts at least two days, so <br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3557-781395.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3557-780548.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">MSG section in Wal*Mart</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3558-739921.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3558-739494.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Score!  Chinese Gillette razor blades!</p></div><br /><br />Picked up 10 packs, which should last at least 90 days, for a total of 14 AUD.  Not too shabby.<br /><br />Other sections included a big produce section, a deli which sold live fish, and a whole heap of yummy looking baked goods.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3559-779764.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3559-779376.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Live fish for sale</p></div><br /><br />I think you really could buy everything there.<br /><br />Paid for the blades and walked back to get to the hotel.<br /><br />Finished packing, checked out, and took the airport bus to the airport.<br /><br />Spoke to a girl from Guanzho briefly, but she wanted to sleep.<br /><br />We passed a "non stale food market".  :-)<br /><br />Further along the road, there was an overturned tractor being lifted up by a crane.  It looked like either a wheel had fallen off or an axle had snapped.<br /><br />The airport bus stopped at terminal 1, which was only for a few airlines.  An American couple started getting off, but I said to them "there are two terminals", since I think they assumed the bus was only stopping there.  They got off anyway.<br /><br />The bus drove to terminal 2.<br /><br />Got off.<br /><br />Grabbed the suitcase from the storage area, thanked the driver, and walked towards the check-in counter.<br /><br />Wallet?  Check.<br /><br />Ticket?  Check.<br /><br />Passport?<br /><br />Passport?<br /><br />Passport?<br /><br />Hmm.  Not good.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2009.html">2009</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/China.html">China</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Lost%20Passport.html">Lost Passport</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Travel.html">Travel</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Xian.html">Xian</a></p>
