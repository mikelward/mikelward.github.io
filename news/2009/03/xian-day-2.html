            <div style="clear:both;"></div>The "Eastern tour" was leaving at 9.<br /><br />Went down for another interesting breakfast experience.<br /><br />Still had plenty of spare time, so watched some TV.  There were a lot of Chinese action movies that reminded me of Monkey Magic, a show that I watched on ABC as a kid.<br /><br />Got down to the foyer at 8.30, waited a bit, chatted to the tour guide, who thankfully spoke English (one of the benefits of this tour group), had a chat to some of the other people from the Melody who were going on the tour, and got on the bus.<br /><br />In particular, one guy was called Jimmy.  He was from Taiwan and spoke good English.  He worked for a semi-conductor distribution company.<br /><br />We also picked up a group of foreign language teachers from Shanghai, Leonardo, Caitlin, and Marco.<br /><br />At the last stop, we picked up some American girls, Sami and Sam.<br /><br />Had a decent chat.<br /><br />First stop was a museum about an old village, and they way they buried people.  They also had a kiln.  Babied were buried inside urns.  Adults were buried with some loved possessions that might have been needed in the afterlife.  Their heads faced West if they died a natural death and East if they died an unnatural death.  The best theory is that West resembles the setting sun, and hence the end of life.<br /><br />Started talking to some others in the group, including Kenneth and Chris, who were working on the development and testing of Windows Mobile.<br /><br />Next stop was a pottery store that sold many things, but the obvious drawcard was the scale terracotta warriors.  Ended up giving in, deciding I needed some more souvenirs, and bought a couple as a set for 700 Yuan.  Think I probably paid too much, but they looked to be good quality.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3465-708538.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3465-708152.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Big statue of a horse and knight in the middle of a roundabout</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3466-719175.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3466-718728.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Me as a terracotta warrior?</p></div><br /><br />Later we passed some shops selling poor quality ones for much, much less.  Perhaps as low as 1 Yuan.  Still, if my other ones make it home in one piece, I'll be happy.<br /><br />Stopped for lunch.  There was a guy twirling the noodles right in front of us.  Had a pretty good Chinese-style meal.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3475-799795.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3475-799353.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Some of the guys in the tour group: Sami, Jimmy, tour guide, Dmitri</p></div><br /><br />Then on to the Terracotta Army!<br /><br />Drove for a while, maybe half an hour if I remember correctly.  The entrance to the Terracotta Army was quite strange and understated.  We drove thru a little village and stopped near a town square.<br /><br />After a bit of a walk, they had some large archways and buildings that gave it the grandeur I was expecting.<br /><br />Was pretty cool, but not exactly what I thought it would be.  A bit portion of the chamber was still being excavated and repaired.<br /><br />Lots of different types of units.  The main ones were generals, warriors, archers, horses and cavalrymen.<br /><br />Interestingly, they were aligned in what was supposed to be the battle formation of the day, so its purpose was to protect the emperor in the afterlife.<br /><br />Some way to go!<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3478-767577.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3478-767139.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">The Terracotta Army</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3485-799407.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3485-798969.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Me and the Terracotta Army!</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3491-719722.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3491-718079.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Some soldiers up close</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3495-751569.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3495-750747.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Some horses up close</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3506-789905.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3506-789502.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">A kneeling archer</p></div><br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3511-747048.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3511-746663.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Back in the courtyard outside, mountains in the distance</p></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2009.html">2009</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/China.html">China</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Travel.html">Travel</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Xian.html">Xian</a></p>
