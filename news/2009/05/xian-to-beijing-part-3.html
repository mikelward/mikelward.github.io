            <div style="clear:both;"></div>The police officer told me it would take over an hour to walk to the train station, and I had luggage, so I walked to the nearest intersection hoping to find a cab.<br /><br />Instead, there were two motor bike taxis.<br /><br />One of them came up to me, and tried to get me to go with him.<br /><br />I pointed at my suitcase and looked confused, as if to say, there's no way you're going to fit that!<br /><br />He gestured at the little footwell on his moped.<br /><br />No, that's fine thanks, and kept walking.<br /><br />Another 20 metres down the road, and with a better view of the intersection, and still no proper taxis in sight.<br /><br />Oh well!  It'll be an experience.<br /><br />How much?  Two.<br /><br />OK.<br /><br />I held on precariously as he drove all over the road, on the long trip to the train station.<br /><br />I figured there was no point getting tense, so instead I just held on, tried to mimic his movements (e.g. leaning into the corners), and tried to focus on the scenery.<br /><br />We went past a nice big park and some office buildings on the northern side of the city, heading East.<br /><br />Then we turned North and it started to get a bit more gritty.<br /><br />At one stage, there were three buses coming at us from every direction.  It looked like they were going to hit us, but I figured there was nothing I could do, so just held my breath and waited.<br /><br />They stopped JUST before us.<br /><br />After that, the experience actually became fun in a hysterical kind of way.  It felt like we were invincible, weaving in and out of the traffic.  Kind of like riding the motorbike on the farm, or playing a racing game on the computer, except not having the controls in my hands.<br /><br />Finally we got to the station.  At first I thought the newish looking shops were the station, but it was actually a big communist-style building across a big dusty plaza on the other side.<br /><br />Gave him a 100 Yuan bill, but he didn't have change, so we to'd and fro'd until I agreed to go to a nearby stand and buy something to get change.  As usual, they inspected the 100 Y bill, then gave me my bottle of water and some change.<br /><br />Gave the driver a 20 and made my way to the station.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3571-1-799948.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/img_3571-1-799422.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">My moped taxi</p></div><div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2009.html">2009</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/China.html">China</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Lost%20Passport.html">Lost Passport</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Travel.html">Travel</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Xian.html">Xian</a></p>
