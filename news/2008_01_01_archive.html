            <div style="clear:both;"></div>I went to the <a href="http://www.australianopen.com/">Australian Open</a> this week with Katie.<br /><br />We had the night free and I'd never been to the tennis so it seemed like a good idea!<br /><br />There were a few big name players, but tickets to their matches were already sold out, so we just got a $20 after-work ground pass ticket, which lets you go to any match on the outside courts.<br /><br />Most matches were starting a bit later, so we went to get some food and a beer, and have a walk around.  The food was nothing special, but the atmosphere was great.  It felt a lot like the world cup in Germany, and the weather was nice and hot (over 30 degrees).<br /><br />We saw a really bad match on a side court for about ten minutes, then went off to see Economidis versus Gonzalez at Margaret Court Arena, which sounded like the best event on the ground courts.<br /><br />It sure was!<br /><br /><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00401-719946.JPG"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00401-719922.JPG" border="0" alt="" /></a><br /><br />For the first few sets, it was a really close game, with some good rallies, some good skills, but also far too many unforced errors.  Still, it was really good to watch.<br /><br />There were a huge group of Chilean supporters there to support Gonzalez thruout the whole stadium, and a section of Greek supporters in one corner loudly singing and supporting Economidis.<br /><br />Towards the middle of the game, the umpire started asking the Greek fans to be quiet.  It wasn't obvious why, since the Chileans were just as vocal.<br /><br />Eventually the police were called in.  From the other end of the stadium, it looked like they tried to remove one of the Greek supporters, but he resisted.  A short time later, the police used capsicum spray.  They used a lot of spray, and it got on lots of people nearby.<br /><br />It became quite an incident, with it being reported in news outlets in several countries.<br /><br />Without knowing the details, I thought the Greek section were just providing a great atmosphere and having some fun, so it's disappointing that it came to this.  Still, physically resisting police officers isn't a very smart idea.<br /><br />That aside, Gonzalez ended up winning the match.<br /><br />I'll definitely try to get tickets next year!<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2008.html">2008</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Melbourne.html">Melbourne</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Sport.html">Sport</a></p>
