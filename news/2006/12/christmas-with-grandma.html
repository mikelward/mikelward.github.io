            <div style="clear:both;"></div>This year we had Christmas in Melbourne at my Aunty's place in Surrey Hills.<br /><br />We were planning to go to <a href="http://www.dinnerplain.com/">Dinner Plain</a> near Mount Hotham where my family own a chalet, but the bushfires near Harrietville made it too risky.  The last <a href="http://www.dse.vic.gov.au/DSE/nrenfoe.nsf/LinkView/E20ACF3A4A127CB04A25679300155B04358FFCDA5CA1F43FCA256DA6000942C9">major fires in 2003</a> did some big damage.<br /><br />Instead, my Mum, Dad and Grandma came over to Melbourne to have Christmas with us.  It was the first time I'd seen Grandma in ages.  My brother Chris couldn't make it, since he was visiting his girlfrend in Boston.<br /><br />We had a roast turkey, a few glasses of wine, and ended up watching March of the Penguins, a present Mum gave me.  It was actually quite a pleasant and relaxing day.<br /><br />The next day, we went to the <a href="http://www.visityarravalley.com.au/">Yarra Valley</a> to go wine tasting.  By the time we got there, it was about 2pm, so we were all fairly hungry.  We ended up going to <a href="http://www.yering.com/cpa/htm/htm_home.asp?siteClass=yering">Yering Station</a>, which was the first place we found advertising food!<br /><br />They have a big homestead turned into accommdation and dining.  Had to go thru a waiting room to get a table.  Once we sat down, the waitress tried to put a serviette on my lap.  I looked at her funny as if to say "I am perfectly capable of doing this myself!", then looked a little sheepish and apologised.  It'd obviously been far too long since I'd been to a silver service restaurant!<br /><br />I had a steak with mustard and chips arranged in a box shape.  Presentation obviously counts!  It didn't taste too bad either. :-)<br /><br /><div><br /><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00061-706361.JPG"><img class="photo" src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00061-798756.JPG" alt="Mum and Dad at Yering Station" /></a><p class="caption">Mum and Dad at Yering Station</p><br /></div><br /><br />We then spent the rest of the day driving around looking for wine to taste.  The main one we went to was <a href="http://www.debortoli.com.au/">De Bortolli</a>, which seems to be quite famous in Melbourne.  I was the designated driver (just to be sure!), so I didn't end up trying anything.  Entered a TAC designated driver competition.  (With my luck lately, you never know!)  Dad didn't have any interest for the wine, so ended up trying cheeses.  He's become quite a wine snob since taking a more keen interest in the Coonawarra, McLaren Vale and Barossa Valley!  Instead he found an old Italian style of cheese made from raw (unpasteurised) milk for about $60/kg!<br /><br /><div><br /><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00067-733263.JPG"><img class="photo" src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/DSC00067-725496.JPG" alt="Grandma at De Bortoli" /></a><p class="caption">Grandma at De Bortoli</p><br /></div><br /><br />We then came back via Healesville.  The trip was quite scenic.  Reminded me of driving thru the Victorian alps.  It was quite windy.  Apparently there's a well-known motorbike run nearby called the <a href="http://www.visitvictoria.com/displayObject.cfm/objectid.00064EAD-739A-1EF6-9E6080C476A90000/vvt.vhtml">Black Spur</a> that a frend Nag told me about.<br /><br />The next day, we went to the National Gallery, had lunch at a really modest (but delicious) Thai restaurant on Southbank called Jasmine, saw Casino Royale (which was really good), then Mum and Dad went home.<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2006.html">2006</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Family.html">Family</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Food.html">Food</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Holidays.html">Holidays</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Wine.html">Wine</a></p>
