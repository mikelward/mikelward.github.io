            <div style="clear:both;"></div>I had been hoping to go to the <a href="http://www.fifaworldcup.com/">soccer world cup</a> in Germany this year.<br /><br />It was a long term plan of mine to revisit Europe after staying in Austria for 8 months as a 15 year old on a student exchange.<br /><br />I started trying to get tickets as soon as I watched the qualifier between Australia and Uguguay back in Sydney, and applied for tickets in the ballot, which apparently was already up to round 3 of sales.<br /><br />I got an e-mail in early Feb telling me that I hadn't been allocated any tickets.  I thought that was pretty bad luck, since I'd applied for the maximum possible, all three of Australia's round 1 matches, and figured it was fairly likely I'd get at least one.  It wasn't good news, but I still held some hope of getting tickets in the last round of sales.<br /><br />Round 4 started last night at 10, so I got to the web site about 9.45 to try to get in early.  At about 10 o'clock, the site opened for business.  I was optimistic, as it told me there were still limited tickets available for two of Australia's three round 1 matches: Australia versus Brazil in Munich, and Australia versus Croatia in Stuttgart.  I guess there weren't any for Australia versus Japan, as the match was being played at Kaiserslautern, which can't fit as many people in the stadium.<br /><br />On my first attempt, after selecting the tickets I wanted, I got as far as "the waiting room", which was supposed to be the last step before getting the tickets, but for some reason I could go no further.  On subsequent retries, I just kept getting error messages.  They didn't say anything meaningful, but I assume that Yahoo!'s web servers were so busy that they just couldn't handle the load.<br /><br />I sat there retrying until about 1am, when I decided I needed to get some sleep.  I set my alarm and went to sleep.<br /><br />I woke up again at 2am, and was disappointed to find there was <span style="font-weight: bold;">nothing</span> left!<br /><br />Going to keep going back to the site regularly to see if any more tickets have come on sale, but I guess I'm going to have to rethink my plans.  :-(<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2006.html">2006</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Shopping.html">Shopping</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Sport.html">Sport</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Travel.html">Travel</a></p>
