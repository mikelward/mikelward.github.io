I didn't get a very good lather.  I shaved my face twice going downwards, applying the soap lather before each pass.  It wasn't a close shave, but there were no cuts or irritation afterwards, so it was an OK start.<br /><br />I went and bought a $5 porcelain bowl from a homewares store and used it to make the lather for my second shave.  It was much better.  I did it by starting before my shower, filling the bowl with hot water, putting the brush in the bowl, and putting a tiny bit of hot water on top of the soap.  When I got out of the shower, I emptied the bowl into the sink (with the plug in), tipped the soapy water into the bowl, squeezed the brush dry, pushed it firmly into the soap and did a few circles, then started whisking it with the soapy water in the bowl.  Got a really good result in about a minute.<br /><br />The shave itself was good.  I did three downward passes.  Probably as close as an average cartridge razor, but not especially close.  Still, I had no irritation and I was presentable.<br /><br />Third shave was quite good.  A little better than the second.  This time I focussed more on the angle.  I tried about 30 degrees for the first pass and about 40 degrees for the second pass.  Inspite of most of the tutorials saying 30 degrees is the correct angle, I found that with my razor, something closer to 40 was the best.  It gave the closest shave.  You could also hear it was cutting more hair, as the razor makes a subtle rumbling sound as you shave.<br /><br /><div class="figure"><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/Image021-1-707676.jpg"><img src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/Image021-1-707665.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a><p class="caption">Me after my third shave</p></div><br /><br />My fourth shave wasn't so good.  I had to do four passes to get the same effect and it left my face stinging slightly.  I think it was because the blade was getting blunt, so I changed it.<br /><br />My fifth shave was as good as the third.<br /><br />And today, I had my best shave yet.  I did three downward passes, keeping the angle at about 40 degrees.  It produced no irritation, and a nice smooth face, but only in the downward direction.  If I put my hand against my face and run it upward, I can feel some stubble.<br /><br />Tomorrow I'm going to be brave and gently try an upward (against the grain) third pass.  This is what mantic's original videos recommended (see my original post), but I was too scared to try it because it always gave me ingrown hairs when using a cartridge razor.<br /><br />Wish me luck!<br /><br />(Also, thanks to all the guys who gave me good advice on the <a href="http://badgerandblade.com">Badger and Blade forums</a>.)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2008.html">2008</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Grooming.html">Grooming</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Shaving.html">Shaving</a></p>
