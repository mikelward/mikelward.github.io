            <div style="clear:both;"></div>I went to Adelaide for Easter this year.  Flew out Friday lunch time with Virgin Blue.  Was able to offset my carbon emissions for about $1.50 for the return trip, which sounded suspiciously low.<br /><br />The flight was great.  Nan came to pick me up at the airport in her new Kia.  Her Pulsar had been recently stolen, and she bought a Kia Cerato with the insurance payout.<br /><br />We went back to her place in Parafield Gardens, had a bit of a chat, caut up with my cousin Jamie and Nan's boyfrend Tony.  Rod, an old workmate and frend from Wodonga came around for dinner.<br /><br />On Saturday, I went to see Linda and her boyfrend Okke for lunch at Sushi Train near the Adelaide Central Markets.  After lunch, we went shopping.  I bought some Lindt dark chocolates and Coopers Extra Dark Stout.<br /><br /><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/image1787.jpg"><img class="photo" src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/image1787-small.jpg" border=0 alt='' /></a><br /><p class="caption">Linda and Okke</p><br /><br />We went back to Linda's place in Gilberton (just to the North of North Adelaide), met Okke properly, then discussed past events, relationships, and the meaning of life.  :-)<br /><br />That night, Linda and Okke took me to a frend's party in the East End of Adelaide.  Drank too much, stayed up too late!  Had a great time!  It was revealed that Okke and his mates were card-carrying Adelaide United members, so we arranged to travel to each other's home matches.  Apparently they've got a blow-up doll of Kevin Muscat, but I'm sure it's all in good sport... :-/<br /><br /><a href="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/image1788.jpg"><img class="photo" src="http://mikelward.com/news/uploaded_images/image1788-small.jpg" border=0 alt='' /></a><br /><p class="caption">Beehive Corner, Rundle Mall</p><br /><br />On Sunday, we went to see the Egyptian exhibit from the Louvre at the Art Gallery.  It was a little bit interesting, but I always find myself wanting to know more than the signs tell.  They also used some weird terminology, possibly due to the translation from French, and called the Sun God "Re" rather than the familiar "Ra".<br /><br />We went back to Linda's place.  I saw the first half of the Western Bulldogs getting convincingly beaten (again!), then we went out for dinner to an Indian restaurant on Melbourne Street.<br /><br />After dinner, we went to see The Host at Palace Cinema.  Kinda fortunately for me, it wasn't on.  I had been really wanting to see The Lives of Others, and that was on in about 15 minutes, so we did that instead.<br /><br />The movie turned out to be really good.  A bit of a Schindler's List type of movie in that the circumstances are those of oppression and control of a war-like regime, and that it focussed on a small group of peeple to show its effects.  The story was great and was made very emotive by the direction and cinematography.  I felt really worried and concerned for the characters.  The ending was good, and really helped show that it's the peeple of the regime that make up the regime.  It was also rather ironic, considering one of the main undertones of the movie was suicide.  It lead to some interesting discussions afterwards.<br /><br />Got back to Nan's place a bit after midnight, and flew out the next morning.<br /><br />Felt quite sick by the Monday night.  Ended up in bed for most of the week with tonsillitis.<br /><br />(I didn't kiss anyone Katie, honest!) ;-)<div style="clear:both; padding-bottom:0.25em"></div><p class="blogger-labels">Labels: <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/2007.html">2007</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Adelaide.html">Adelaide</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Entertainment.html">Entertainment</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Family.html">Family</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Food.html">Food</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Frends.html">Frends</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Friends.html">Friends</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Holidays.html">Holidays</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Movies.html">Movies</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Sport.html">Sport</a>, <a rel='tag' href="http://mikelward.com/news/labels/Travel.html">Travel</a></p>
